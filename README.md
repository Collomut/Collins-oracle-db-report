> The initial assignment was done on the oracle 23c which run smoothly on creation and deletion but got persistent errors while trying to access the Oracle Enterprise Manager this was due to a conflict with the environment variables. The whole problem led to the clean uninstallation of the Oracle 23c and opting for a more stable Oracle 19c which worked well with no issues at all.
